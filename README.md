### TLDR

I work mostly in geoinformatics.  For me, this tends to be an  intersection of 
software development, semantics, structured data on the web and web architecture. 

### About me

I work for the Consortium for Ocean Leadership.  They are headquartered in 
Washington D.C. but I live and work from a small town in Iowa.   Iowa is my 
home state and I have lived here all my life.  

### Stats

Some auto generated stats from [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).  Not sure if they 
track the private repos though, need to look into that.   For this most part this is just data without context.  :)

### Currently

I've been exploring digital object patterns like 
RDA's Digital Object Cloud and structured data on the web (schema.org et al).   
I've been developing [Gleaner](https://gleaner.io/), [Mercantile](https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-project418/mercantile) 
and [GROW](https://github.com/fils/goobjectweb) to support this exploration.  

Mercantile is a means to test  GraphQL for searching graphs.  I'm leveraging the 
99desgins [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) package for this. 
I've tried to focus on pure GraphQL and not some of the extensions out there that 
more explicitly connect graphs and GraphQL.   Though I do like some of what DGraph
and other are doing.  

Though I've working quite a bit with SPARQL I've always enjoyed working in Gremlin, 
so I sometimes wonder about moving to that ecosystem.   If I do, I am really 
impressed with Janus Graph and have thought about doing more there.  

I'm very interested in JSON-LD and applying things like SHACL to data graph work 
flows and been active in exploring that.   Generating GraphQL interfaces from SHACL 
shapes is a goal of mine.  This has been done by groups like TopQuadrant, but I am not
aware of open source packages for this.  

I've also been fortunate enough to be involved with a group working in 
the NFS Convergence Accelerator:
[Urban Flooding OKN](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/Award%20Listings/track-a.jsp).  
Connecting the digital object space to knowledge graphs is an interest of mine as well.  

### Community

I've worked form home for quite some time.   As such, community organizations are
very important to me. The provide a means for me to connect with my peers from 
rural Iowa.  The four most valuable to me include.

* Earth Science Information Partnership ([ESIP](https://www.esipfed.org/))
    * [Semantic Technologies Committee](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Semantic_Technologies)
    * [Science On Schema](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org)
* [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/)
    * [Council of Data Facilities](https://www.earthcube.org/group/council-data-facilities)
    * [Technology and Architecture Committee](https://www.earthcube.org/group/technology-architecture-committee)
* Research Data Alliance ([RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/)) ([profile & groups](https://www.rd-alliance.org/users/fils))
* AGU [ESSI](https://connect.agu.org/essi/home)

I've also had some rewarding time with [CODATA](https://codata.org/) and been very fortunate to interact with the 
[DDI](https://ddialliance.org/) group through them.

### Where I would like to learn when I get time.

I'm not much a user interface developer.   I spend most of my time with data and 
back end server side code to work with data.  I have done a bit of work with 
web components and quite enjoy them.  

So, when I get free time, I enjoy trying
to explore richer client side tools.   I've not gotten far, so any help or pointers will
be welcomed. 

* Flutter and hence Dart
* Web assembly, especially with languages like Rust and Go
