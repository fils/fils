### TLDR

I work mostly in geoinformatics.  That ends up mostly being an intersection of 
software development, semantics, web architecture for me.  Lately I've been 
working with structured data on the web in relation to all this.  

### About me

I work for the Consortium for Ocean Leadership.  They are headquartered in 
Washington D.C. but I live and work from a small town in Iowa.   Iowa is my 
home state and I have lived here all my life.  

### Currently

I've been working mostly in the intersection of digital object patterns like 
RDA's Digital Object Cloud and structured data on the web (schema.org et al).   
I've been working on 
code like Gleaner, Mercantile and GROW to support this exploration.  

I've also been working on tools to test using GraphQL as a means to search graphs.  
I've tried to focus on pure GraphQL and not some of the extensions out there that 
more explicitly connect graphs and GraphQL.   

Though I've working quite a bit 
with SPARQL I've always enjoyed working in Gremlin, so I sometimes wonder about 
moving to that ecosystem.   If I do, I am really impressed with Janus Graph and 
have thought about doing more there.  

I'm very interested in JSON-LD and applying things like SHACL to data graph work 
flows and been active in exploring that.  

I've also been fortunate enough to be involved with a group working in 
the NFS Convergence Accelerator:
[Urban Flooding OKN](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/Award%20Listings/track-a.jsp)

### Community

I've worked form home for quite some time.   As such, community organizations are
very important to me.  The four most valuable to me include.

* Earth Science Information Partnership ([ESIP](https://www.esipfed.org/))
    * [Semantic Technologies Committee](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Semantic_Technologies)
    * [Science On Schema](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org)
* [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/)
    * [Council of Data Facilities](https://www.earthcube.org/group/council-data-facilities)
    * [Technology and Architecture Committee](https://www.earthcube.org/group/technology-architecture-committee)
* Research Data Alliance ([RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/)) ([profile & groups](https://www.rd-alliance.org/users/fils))
* AGU [ESSI](https://connect.agu.org/essi/home)

I've also enjoyed time with [CODATA](https://codata.org/) and been very fortunate to interact with the 
[DDI](https://ddialliance.org/) group through them.

### Where I would like to learn when I get time.

I'm not much a user interface developer.   I spend most of my time with data and 
back end server side code to work with it.  So when I get free time I enjoy trying
to explore client side tools.   I've not gotten far, so any help or pointers will
be welcomed. 

* Flutter and hence Dart
* Web assembly, especially with languages like Rust and Go
