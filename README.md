### TLDR

I work mostly in geoinformatics.  For me, this tends to be an  intersection of 
software development, semantics, data  and web architecture. 

### About me

I am part of the [Ronin Institute](https://ronininstitute.org/about/) now.
I live and work from Slater, a small town in Iowa.   Iowa is my
home state and I have lived here all my life and always plan to.

### Stats

Some auto generated stats from [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).  Not sure if they 
track the private repos though, need to look into that.
For the most part this is just data without context, so of no real use.

### Currently

I've been exploring digital object patterns like 
RDA's Digital Object Cloud and structured data on the web (schema.org et al).   
I've been developing [Gleaner](https://gleaner.io/) and
[https://github.com/gleanerio](https://github.com/gleanerio) as well as some
tools like Mercantile](https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-project418/mercantile)
and [GROW](https://github.com/fils/goobjectweb) to support this exploration.  

Though I've working quite a bit with SPARQL I've always enjoyed working in Gremlin.
I really enjoy all sorts of graph ecosystems.  I've been wanting to do something with
Janus Graph, but tend to star in RDF land.

I'm very interested in JSON-LD and applying things like SHACL to data graph work 
flows and been active in exploring that.   

I've also been fortunate enough to be involved with a group working in 
the NFS Convergence Accelerator:
[Urban Flooding OKN](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/Award%20Listings/track-a.jsp).  
Connecting the digital object space to knowledge graphs is an interest of mine as well.  

### Community

I've worked form home for quite some time.   As such, community organizations are
very important to me. The provide a means for me to connect with my peers from 
rural Iowa.  The four most valuable to me include.

* Earth Science Information Partnership ([ESIP](https://www.esipfed.org/))
    * [Semantic Technologies Committee](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Semantic_Technologies)
    * [Science On Schema](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org)
* [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/)
    * [Council of Data Facilities](https://www.earthcube.org/group/council-data-facilities)
    * [Technology and Architecture Committee](https://www.earthcube.org/group/technology-architecture-committee)
* Research Data Alliance ([RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/)) ([profile & groups](https://www.rd-alliance.org/users/fils))
* AGU [ESSI](https://connect.agu.org/essi/home)

I've also had some rewarding time with [CODATA](https://codata.org/) and been very fortunate to interact with the 
[DDI](https://ddialliance.org/) group through them.  I've also had the good fortune to work with the ODIS OIH 
project.  This project is  supporting discovery and interoperability of existing information systems through the 
development of a lightweight Ocean Data and Information System (ODIS) architecture and more information 
can be found at [https://oceaninfohub.org/](https://oceaninfohub.org/).

### What I would like to learn when I get time.

Looking forward to diving into decentralized system more and decentralized ledgers.
Not really that into DeFi stuff, though I do play a bit there.  More into things like
self sovereign IDs and curious how DAOs could be used for governance of
FAIR implementation networks for example.
